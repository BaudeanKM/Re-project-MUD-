# Re-project-MUD-
I want this project to be a MUD taking place in a modern universe

## What is the purpose of this project ?

It helped me discover the world of codding, I love rpg and mud games and I wanted to create mine.
All this project is just about pages connected to each other, some text boxes, buttons and list test in order to  initiate the creation of a character for example.
